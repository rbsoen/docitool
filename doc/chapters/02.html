    The preprocessor receives as its input an HTML file,
    and outputs another HTML file on stdout. It operates in
    two stages:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>
            <b>Stage 1</b>: the main processing stage.
            Commands that only apply to one specific file&mdash;such
            as include and rendering commands&mdash;may run here.
            It should be considered safe to run the commands
            multiple times in a single conversion run.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            <b>Stage 2</b>: post processing stage.
            Commands that only apply to the resulting document
            may run here. They will run just before the final
            file is returned. For example, table of contents,
            references, and other such commands that
            require the main content to be "fully baked".
        </p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Each stage has its own set of commands which take some state
    and replaces the command invocation with the result of the command.
    Dispatchers are used to map the correct command with the correct
    function in the program.
    </p>

    <h3 id="c0202" class="break-before">Command Parsing</h3>

    <p>
    In an input HTML file, commands take the form of <code>{{ verbatim: {{ command: arguments }} }}</code>.
    If there are no arguments, it becomes simply <code>{{ verbatim: {{ command: }} }}</code>. A simple
    split is performed on the <code>:</code> character, such that the command name ends up on the left hand
    side, and the arguments on the right hand side.
    </p>

    <p>
    The dispatcher takes the command name and uses a look up table to determine the correct function.
    If the dispatcher is unable to find such a function for the invoked command, or the invocation itself
    is malformed, no replacement is made and the original invocation remains in the resulting HTML document.
    The process is repeated for all detected command invocations.
    </p>

    <h3 id="c0203" class="break-before">Heading Detection</h3>

    <p>
    If table of contents are to be made, the preprocessor enforces correct HTML structuring, as it is necessary
    to ensure a correctly-formatted table. The preprocessor does this by disallowing skipping heading levels when
    going down levels (e.g. h2 then h4 or h5). Each heading <strong>must</strong> be followed by one of:
    content, a heading one or more levels above it, a heading on the same level, or a heading one level below it.
    </p>
