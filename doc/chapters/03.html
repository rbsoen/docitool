    <h2 id="imploverview">Implementation Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The preprocessor requires LXML to be installed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The preprocessor assumes that heading tags (h2, h3, etc.)
        <em>really are</em> used as headings, and not e.g. as a shorthand
        for "bigger text".
        
        It <em>does not</em> allow for skipping headings e.g. h4 after an h2 without
        an intervening h3.

        
        Other than what was just described, it does not validate markup 
        any further than LXML does.

    <h3 id="cmds">Commands</h3>
    <p>
        Every command in a HTML follows this format: <code>{{ verbatim: {{ (command): (arguments) }} }}</code> If there is no arguments,
        the format is simply <code>{{ verbatim: {{ (command): }} }}</code>.

    <h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>

    <p>
    The program can currently be run as a command line program, the following is an excerpt of the terminal output when run with no arguments:
    </p>

<pre>
usage: docitool [-h] [--verbose] [input] [output]

positional arguments:
  input          HTML file, use '-' to pipe from stdin instead
  output         Output HTML file, use '-' to output to stdout instead

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  --verbose, -v  Write more diagnostic output
</pre>

    <p>
    The script being run can be accessed in <code>docitool/__main__.py</code>. There are plans to split the code
    into separate files, and might also implement an add-on system.
