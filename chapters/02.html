    <h3>Stage 1</h3>
    <p>
        This is the main processing stage.
        Commands that need to run per-file, such as
        include and rendering commands may run here.
    </p>

    <h3>Stage 2</h3>
    <p>
        This is the post-processing stage, where
        commands will be run just before the final
        file is returned. For example, table of contents,
        references, and other such commands that
        require the main content to be "fully baked".
