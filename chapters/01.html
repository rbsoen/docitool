    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
        There is a need to create technical documents using
        tooling with just the right amount of control. That is,
        the tooling does not
        perform unwanted formatting for the user (e.g. Microsoft Word,
        LibreOffice and similar products), yet is not
        too complicated or requiring much boilerplate
        to obtain a pleasing result (e.g. LaTeX).

        The tooling should be as unobstrusive as possible,
        yet allows for a predictable result that does not
        require obscure tricks.
    </p><p>
        The author believes that HTML and CSS allows for precisely
        this level of control. HTML's standardized
        <a href="#" data-ref="mdn-html">semantic elements</a>
        as well as the advanced capabilities of modern CSS
        allows for adequate representation of a document in both
        text and print.

    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>
        This document aims to outline the specific system in
        which this document itself is generated with.
