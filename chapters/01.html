    <p>
        There is a need to create technical or academic documents using
        tooling with just the right amount of control. That is,
        the tooling does not
        perform unwanted formatting for the user (e.g. Microsoft Word,
        LibreOffice and similar products), yet is not
        too complicated or requiring much boilerplate
        to obtain a pleasing result (e.g. LaTeX).

        The tooling should be as unobstrusive as possible,
        yet allows for a predictable result that does not
        require obscure tricks.
    </p><p>
        The author believes that HTML and CSS allows for precisely
        this level of control. HTML's standardized
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element" data-ref="mdn-html">semantic elements</a>
        as well as the advanced capabilities of modern CSS
        allows for adequate representation of a document in both
        text and print.

        This is an HTML preprocessor which aims to provide the user
        with a means of generating such documents by focusing on the
        content and style as code, resulting in predictable and more
        consistent documents. The result can act as both a web page in
        its own right, or as printable documentation via the use of
        HTML-to-PDF tooling such as <a href="https://weasyprint.org/">Weasyprint</a>.

        This document aims to outline the specific system in
        which this document itself is generated with, and serves
        as a live example with which to demonstrate the system.
